- The type of values that the publisher can produce.
- The type of error a publisher may produce, or Never if the publisher is guaranteed to not produce an error.
- A subscriber calls subscribe(_:) on a publisher to attach to it.
- The implementation of subscribe(_:) will call receive(subscriber:) to attach the subscriber to the publisher, i.e., create a subscription.

/*:
 - The type of values a subscriber can receive.
 - The type of error a subscriber can receive; or Never if the subscriber wonâ€™t receive an error.
 - The publisher calls receive(subscription:) on the subscriber to give it the subscription.
 - The publisher calls receive(_:) on the subscriber to send it a new value that it just published.
 - The publisher calls receive(completion:) on the subscriber to tell it that it has finished producing values, either normally or due to an error.
